This [example version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jm15OeR6mS6vbJd7atHErOwBgq2SwKAagb4MH0D1aIw/edit?usp=sharing) describes an open source platform for rallying citizens to civic engagement called Democrasee (github.com/DemocraseeClub). Screenshots are below:

![Permissions Matrix](docs/permissions-matrix-democrasee.png)


All Select options under Fields Types (Column D) in the Object Fields sheet come from column A in the "selectors" sheet. If you have special field types, add them here. The checkboxes roughly describe what Fields are support by the different CMS config builders in this repository.
